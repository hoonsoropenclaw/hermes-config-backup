Most pages don't need it. The strongest hero is often a typographic one. **Reach for [`hero-enrichment.md`](references/hero-enrichment.md) only when the brief points there** — a SaaS / dev-tool brief wants a demo video or mockup; a bakery / café / atelier brief wants a hand-built illustration; a manifesto wants nothing.

**First — does the brief need imagery at all?** Run the image-need table at [`hero-enrichment.md` § Image-need detection](references/hero-enrichment.md). Default is typography-only. If the brief signals "needs photographic content" (e-commerce, team, food, travel) AND the user hasn't supplied real assets, use the placeholder strategy in [`assets.md` § Placeholder strategy](references/assets.md). If the brief allows non-photographic imagery (SaaS landing, manifesto, agency splash, editorial-led), prefer the [`imagery-kit.md`](references/imagery-kit.md) over photo placeholders. **Never ship invented stock photos as if they were the final design.**

Eyeball the brief or ask one short question. State the decision in one sentence (e.g., *"Enrichment: E1 Clipped-Edge Demo Video, Tier-A CSS-art mockup."* or *"Enrichment: none — typography only."*). The decision goes into the macrostructure stamp at Step 6.

**The enrichment hierarchy is non-negotiable.** Reach for the highest tier you can ship: typography only → Tier A pure CSS art → Tier B hand-built SVG → Tier C generated still (Nanobanana / Recraft) → Tier D library + customisation → **Tier E Lottie is last resort**, only for complex character motion that hand-build can't reach. Reaching for Lottie when CSS would have built it is the new tell.

When an enrichment archetype requires construction, also load [`custom-craft.md`](references/custom-craft.md). When it requires an external asset, load [`assets.md`](references/assets.md).

### 5. Preview

Before emitting any code, output a tight summary of what you're about to ship. This is the user's TL;DR — they should be able to scan it in five seconds and tell you to redirect *before* you write 500 lines of CSS that don't match their intent.

**Format** (Markdown bullets, not ASCII boxes — they render reliably across every chat client and terminal):

```markdown
**Hallmark · v1.0.0**

- **Macrostructure** · Stat-Led
- **Theme** · Plain (#fff paper · cool greys · ink-blue accent)
- **Enrichment** · none (typography only)
- **Sections** · Hero · Logos · Stats · Features · Testimonials · Pricing · FAQ · CTA · Footer
- **Motion** · counter · pricing-lift · pulse-once
- **Slop test** · 69 / 69 ✓ (run after Build)
- **Diversification** · differs from Linen on display style + accent hue
```

**Six required bullets, one optional, plus a CTA line:**

1. **Macrostructure** — the named pick from [`macrostructures.md`](references/macrostructures.md).
2. **Theme** — for catalog: name + one-line palette summary (paper colour band · accent hue · display style). For custom: `custom (vibe: "<4–8 words>" · paper oklch(<L%> <C> <H>) · accent oklch(<L%> <C> <H>) <one-word hue label> · <display face> + <body face>)`.
3. **Enrichment** — the chosen archetype + tier, or *none (typography only)*.
4. **Sections** — section names separated by ` · `, in DOM order.
5. **Motion** — microinteraction primitives separated by ` · `, or *none — typography only*. Always under three primitives per the [`microinteractions.md`](references/microinteractions.md) hard rules.
6. **Slop test** — `69 / 69 ✓` if all gates pass, or `N / 69 — fails: <gate numbers>` if any are open. Run the slop test BEFORE writing this row; the slop test is Step 7.
7. **Diversification** *(optional, only when `.hallmark/log.json` has prior entries)* — what axes differ vs the previous run.

**Then one quiet CTA line, italicised, after the bullets:**

> *System portable? Say `lock the system` to extract this build's tokens + voice into a `design.md`.*

Skip the CTA line when (a) the build is component-scope, or (b) `design.md` already exists at the project root (the system is already locked). See [`design-md.md`](references/design-md.md) for the full opt-in flow.

Four worked sample preview blocks (Long Document, Bento Grid, Manifesto, Custom) live in [`references/preview-examples.md`](references/preview-examples.md) — load that file only if the bullet-list spec above isn't scaffolding enough on its own. Most builds don't need it.

If any slop-test gate fails when you reach Step 7, return to the relevant Build step, fix it, and **re-emit the preview block** with the corrected slop-test row. The preview is the durable summary; it's wrong to ship if it lies.

### 6. Build

Emit code that satisfies the tone and structural fingerprint. Match the complexity of the code to the ambition of the tone — a brutalist page needs raw, heavy CSS; an austere page needs restraint.

Always:

- **Hero headline — match font-size to copy length.** When you write the headline yourself (no user-supplied copy), aim for **≤ 7 words and ≤ 50 chars** from the start. For longer headlines, apply the size-by-length brackets in [`typography.md § Hero headline sizing`](references/typography.md): 21–50 chars use `--text-display`; 51–90 chars cap at `--text-display-s`; > 90 chars rewrite shorter or cap at `--text-4xl`. Aggressive-display themes (Brutal, Riso, Manifesto) auto-step down one rung past 50 chars — their 6.5–9rem ceiling is for short statements only.
- **Section tags / eyebrows — default OFF.** Do NOT emit `01 · THE TOUR`, `02 / FEATURES`, `Chapter Three`, or any uppercase mono-cap section number / kicker / label unless either (a) the user explicitly asked for chapter / step / section numbering, OR (b) the macrostructure is Long Document, Manifesto, or Catalogue numbered AND the content is genuinely ordinal. Cap at 1–2 per page even then. **When a tag IS used, always stack vertical — tag above, heading directly underneath in the same column.** The tag-left / heading-right two-column pattern (a.k.a. hanging header, left-margin label) is banned outright — it is the single most reliable templated-editorial tell, and slop-test gate **66** auto-fails it.
- Use OKLCH for every colour. Declare tokens as CSS custom properties at `:root`.
- Use a 4pt spacing scale with semantic names (`--space-sm`, `--space-md`, …).
- Pick a distinctive display face and a refined body face. Pairings, not single-font pages — *unless* the single-font choice IS the design (a true terminal-aesthetic page is monospace-only on purpose; that's allowed).
- Design every interactive element for its full eight states (see [`interaction-and-states.md`](references/interaction-and-states.md)).
- Animate `transform` and `opacity` only — never layout properties.
- Use the three named easings (`--ease-out`, `--ease-in`, `--ease-in-out`) — never the browser default `ease`, never bounce/overshoot on UI state.
- Support `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`. Spatial motion collapses to ≤150ms opacity crossfade.
- Include `:focus-visible` with a visible ring at ≥3:1 contrast. **Never animate the ring's appearance** — it must show instantly on focus.
- For each interaction in the output (button, input, modal, toast, drag, copy, etc.), apply the recipe in [`microinteractions.md`](references/microinteractions.md). Pick *silent success* over celebratory toasts. Pick *optimistic update + Undo* over confirmation dialogs. Pick *delay 800ms* on hover tooltips and *0ms* on focus tooltips.
- Cut motion before adding it. Most pages have too much, not too little. If removing an animation wouldn't lose the user information, remove it.
- **Stamp the output.** The first non-empty line of the produced CSS file (or the top of `<style>` if inline) MUST be a comment of the form: `/* Hallmark · macrostructure: <name> · tone: <tone> · anchor hue: <hue> */`. This stamp is the durable record of what you chose. The next time Hallmark runs in this project, it reads the stamp and picks a *different* macrostructure. **For custom themes**, the stamp also carries the vibe, paper + accent OKLCH values, the chosen display + body fonts, and the three diversification axes — the full multi-line format is in [`custom-theme.md`](references/custom-theme.md) § E. **For studied-DNA builds** (Step 2.6 Condition 0 routed here from a `study` diagnosis), the stamp's `theme:` field is `studied-DNA (source: <URL or "image">)` followed by the paper OKLCH, accent OKLCH, and display + body fonts pulled directly from the diagnosis — not a catalog theme name. Diversification stays suspended for the run; the log entry below records `theme: studied-DNA` so Step 2.5 on the next run knows not to rotate against it.
- **Append to project memory.** After you write the stamp, update (or create) `.hallmark/log.json` at the project root. Append a new entry at the **front** of the array: `{ "date": "<YYYY-MM-DD>", "macrostructure": "<name>", "theme": "<name>", "enrichment": "<E# name or 'none'>", "brief": "<one-line summary>" }`. **Custom entries** also carry `"theme": "custom"` plus `"theme_axes": "<paper-band> / <display-style> / <accent-hue>"` and an optional `"vibe": "<4–8 words>"` — see [`custom-theme.md`](references/custom-theme.md) § F. Trim the file to the last 20 entries (rotate the oldest off). Create `.hallmark/` and the file if they don't exist; respect any existing `.gitignore` (the user may or may not want this committed). This file is what Step 2.5 reads on the next run.
- **Always emit `tokens.css`.** After writing the page CSS, also write `tokens.css` at the project root containing every `--color-*`, `--font-*`, `--space-*`, `--text-*`, `--ease-*`, `--dur-*`, `--rule-*`, and `--radius-*` token used in the build. The page CSS imports `tokens.css` (or, on framework projects, the project's existing entry-point includes it) — the page CSS must reference tokens by name, never inline raw values. Even single-page builds get a `tokens.css`. This is what makes the design system portable to the next project. Load [`export-formats.md`](references/export-formats.md) at this point only when the project warrants additional formats — see below.
- **Multi-format exports on `design.md` projects.** If a `design.md` exists at the project root (a system-managed project), append all four export formats — `tokens.css`, Tailwind v4 `@theme`, DTCG `tokens.json`, shadcn/ui CSS variables — into `design.md`'s `## Exports` section. Load [`export-formats.md`](references/export-formats.md) for the canonical mapping from Hallmark tokens to each format. Single-page projects skip this step (they get only `tokens.css`).
- **Opt-in `design.md` (lock-the-system flow).** If the user explicitly asks Hallmark to lock the build's design system into a portable file (phrases: *"lock the system"*, *"give me a design.md"*, *"make this portable"*, etc.), load [`design-md.md`](references/design-md.md) and follow it. Page-scope only; component-scope skips. **The default verb does NOT auto-emit `design.md`** — users iterate freely first, then ask for it once the system is settled. If `design.md` already exists, refresh its `## Exports` section instead of overwriting. The Step 5 preview block carries a one-line CTA surfacing this option after every page-build.
